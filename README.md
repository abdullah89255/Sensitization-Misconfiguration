# Sensitization-Misconfiguration
Good question 👍

Let’s break it down in simple terms:

---

## 🔹 What is *Sensitization Misconfiguration*?

Actually, the more common security term is **“Sensitive Data Exposure due to Misconfiguration”** (sometimes people loosely say *sensitization misconfiguration*).

It means:
👉 A website or web application is not properly configured to protect **sensitive information** (like passwords, API keys, tokens, session IDs, or PII).

Because of these misconfigurations, attackers can easily **access, leak, or misuse data** that should have been hidden.

---

## 🔹 Common Examples of Misconfigurations Leading to Sensitive Data Exposure:

1. **Default Credentials Left Enabled**

   * Example: Using `admin/admin` or `root/root` and never changing them.

2. **Directory Listing Enabled**

   * `/uploads/` or `/backup/` folders visible, exposing files.

3. **Exposed Configuration Files**

   * Leaving `.env`, `config.php`, or `.git/` accessible publicly.

4. **Improper Access Control**

   * Sensitive endpoints (`/admin`, `/api/v1/users/export`) accessible without authentication.

5. **Unencrypted Data Transmission**

   * Using **HTTP instead of HTTPS**, exposing data in transit.

6. **Verbose Error Messages**

   * Detailed errors leaking DB names, server paths, or API keys.

7. **CORS Misconfiguration**

   * Allowing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` which exposes APIs to any site.

## 🔹 Why It’s Dangerous?

* Hackers can **steal passwords or tokens**.
* Attackers may gain **direct system access** (if configs are exposed).
* Could lead to **account takeover, data breaches, or even full server compromise**.

---

## 🔹 How to Prevent It?

✅ Disable default accounts and credentials
✅ Restrict directory listing & file access
✅ Protect `.env`, `.git/`, backup files
✅ Enforce HTTPS everywhere
✅ Sanitize error messages (no stack traces in prod)
✅ Configure strict **CORS policies**
✅ Regularly audit and harden server/app settings

---

⚡In short:
**Sensitization (sensitive data) misconfiguration** happens when a website is **improperly configured** and leaks or exposes sensitive info, making it an easy target for attackers.
